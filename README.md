# Version-Control-Github-Challenge
Guthub Basic GI week 3


In addition to my project I will like to say that this peoject and previous ones have thought me to be more autonomous and resourceful. I have learned how to manage my time, and apply it to my day to day basis with coding. 
I have learn in such a short amount of time what I never thought to be capable of doing in my whole life time.
